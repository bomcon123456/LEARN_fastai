    "1. Why do we first resize to a large size on the CPU, and then to a smaller size on the GPU?\n",
    "    - Resize to large size (larger than intent size for learning) on CPU **first**: \n",
    "        - Purpose: \n",
    "            - Ensure all images has same size when copied to GPU\n",
    "            - Keep some spare space for us when we use data augmentation in GPU\n",
    "        - Why CPU?\n",
    "            - Copying batch of large size image CPU might take more time?\n",
    "            - Since in CPU we only resize, not doing so many other things, we can resize it in the CPU without lossing many time\n",
    "    - Resize to smaller size (for training) in GPU **later**:\n",
    "        - Purpose:\n",
    "            - Reach to the intent image size, with other data augmentation.\n",
    "        - Why GPU:\n",
    "            - Train in GPU\n",
    "            - GPU works faster for data augmentation because it is optimized for doing the same actions for a batch\n",
    "1. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, find a regular expression tutorial, and some problem sets, and complete them. Have a look on the book website for suggestions.\n",
    "1. What are the two ways in which data is most commonly provided, for most deep learning datasets?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - 1. Individual files representing items of data (text, image,...) organised into folder or file names representing its information\n",
    "    - 2. Table of data (e.g: csv), each row is an item (may include filenames providing a connection between the data in the table and other data)\n",
    "1. Look up the documentation for `L` and try using a few of the new methods is that it adds.\n",
    "1. Look up the documentation for the Python pathlib module and try using a few methods of the Path class.\n",
    "1. Give two examples of ways that image transformations can degrade the quality of the data.\n",
    "    - Make the image too bright/ dark, causing the image to loose its feature\n",
    "    - Flip a cat image upside down, since it's rare to see a cat like that (unless spider-cat is real).\n",
    "1. What method does fastai provide to view the data in a DataLoader?\n",
    "    - `dls.show_batch()`\n",
    "1. What method does fastai provide to help you debug a DataBlock?\n",
    "    - `db.summary()`\n",
    "1. Should you hold off on training a model until you have thoroughly cleaned your data?\n",
    "    - First we should clean the data pretty properly, then we should train so that we can see the baseline of our performance.\n",
    "    - Then we can clean more.\n",
    "1. What are the two pieces that are combined into cross entropy loss in PyTorch?\n",
    "    - log_softmax + negative log likelihood\n",
    "1. What are the two properties of activations that softmax ensures? Why is this important?\n",
    "    - All sum to one\n",
    "    - Positive and exponential\n",
    "    - **Leads to**: significant difference between activation\n",
    "1. When might you want your activations to not have these two properties?\n",
    "    - Want to do inference\n",
    "    - Want the model to tell us whether it recognizes the classes,..\n",
    "1. Calculate the \"exp\" and \"softmax\" columns of <<bear_softmax>> yourself (i.e. in a spreadsheet, with a calculator, or in a notebook).\n",
    "1. Why can't we use torch.where to create a loss function for datasets where our label can have more than two categories?\n",
    "    - In the binary case, we used `torch.where` to select between `inputs` and `1-inputs`, but when there're more categories, it can't simply select value easily to satisfy 2 property: sum to 1 and positive.\n",
    "1. What is the value of log(-2)? Why?\n",
    "    - Since the base b is positive (b>0), the base b raised to the power of y must be positive (by>0) for any real y. So the number x must be positive (x>0).\n",
    "1. What are two good rules of thumb for picking a learning rate from the learning rate finder?\n",
    "    -pick either:\n",
    "        - one order of magnitude less than where the minimum loss was achieved (i.e. the minimum divided by 10)\n",
    "        - the last point where the loss was clearly decreasing. \n",
    "1. What two steps does the fine_tune method do?\n",
    "    - Train the randomly added layers for one epoch, with all other layers frozen ;\n",
    "    - Unfreeze all of the layers, and train them all for the number of epochs requested.\n",
    "1. In Jupyter notebook, how do you get the source code for a method or function?\n",
    "    - `method??`\n",
    "1. What are discriminative learning rates?\n",
    "    - Use a lower learning rate for the early layers of the neural network, and a higher learning rate for the later layers (and especially the randomly added layers).\n",
    "1. How is a Python slice object interpreted when passed as a learning rate to fastai?\n",
    "    - The lower bound is used for those first layers\n",
    "    - The upper bound is used for those last layers\n",
    "    - Those middle will use the lr scale from lowerbound -> upperbound\n",
    "1. Why is early stopping a poor choice when using one cycle training?\n",
    "    - It is very unlikely to give you the best answer, because those epochs in the middle occur before the learning rate has had a chance to reach the small values, where it can really find the best result.\n",
    "1. What is the difference between resnet 50 and resnet101?\n",
    "    - How many layers the model has.\n",
    "1. What does to_fp16 do?\n",
    "    - Change the value to less precise numbers (half precision floating point) use for speed thing up and reduce memory usage."
